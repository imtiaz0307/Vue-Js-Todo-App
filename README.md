# Vue Todo App with CRUD Operations and Dark/Light Theme

Welcome to my first Vue.js project! This simple todo app was created for learning purposes, and it incorporates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations along with a toggleable dark/light theme.

## Project Overview

This project is a single-page application (SPA) built with Vue.js. As a MERN stack developer, I wanted to explore the frontend capabilities of Vue.js and its ease of integration with CRUD operations.

### Features

1. **Create**: Add new tasks to your todo list.
2. **Read**: View your existing tasks and their details.
3. **Update**: Edit task details, such as the task name or completion status.
4. **Delete**: Remove tasks from your todo list.
5. **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between a dark and light theme for a personalized experience.
